#In this SQL, I am querying a database with multiple sales tables in it in order to quantify statistics about customer and order data

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
  FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
  WHERE length(orderid) = 6 AND
  orderid <> 'Order ID'

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID) 
  FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
 WHERE length(orderID) = 6 AND 
       orderID <> 'Order ID' AND 
       Product = 'iPhone';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
  FROM BIT_DB.customers AS c
       INNER JOIN
       BIT_DB.FebSales AS feb ON c.order_id = feb.orderID
 WHERE length(orderID) = 6 AND 
       orderID <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest sold in January and what was the price? 
SELECT DISTINCT Product,
                price
  FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
 WHERE price IN (
           SELECT min(price) 
             FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
       );


#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? 
SELECT Product,
       ROUND(SUM(quantity) * price,2) AS revenue
  FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
 WHERE Product <> 'Product' AND 
       Product <> ''
 GROUP BY Product;


#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product,
       SUM(Quantity),
       SUM(quantity) * price AS revenue
  FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
 WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
 GROUP BY Product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT c.acctnum),
       ROUND(AVG(price * quantity),2) AS average_spent
  FROM BIT_DB.FebSales AS feb
       LEFT JOIN
       BIT_DB.customers AS c ON feb.orderID = c.order_id
 WHERE feb.Quantity > 2 AND 
       length(orderid) = 6 AND 
       orderid <> 'Order ID';

#8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT product,
       SUM(quantity) 
  FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
 WHERE location LIKE '%Los Angeles%'
